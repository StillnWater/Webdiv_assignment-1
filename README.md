# Smart Event Dashboard
The Smart Event Dashboard is a hands-on lab designed to strengthen your understanding of
JavaScript DOM manipulation using pure Vanilla JavaScript. In this lab, you will build a dynamic web
page that allows users to create, view, interact with, and manage event cards without using any
external libraries or frameworks.
This assignment focuses on real-world DOM operations, event handling, and debugging techniques
that are essential for frontend development.
